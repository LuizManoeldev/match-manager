# Match Manager

## Problem Description
Imagine a friendly soccer match where fun should be the rule, but unbalanced team selection turns the game into an uneven competition. "Cliques" (groups of friends) end up forming, making the competition unfair. From this problem arose the Match Manager (MManager), the solution to ensure that each game is exciting, competitive, and, above all, fair.

The idea of MManager is that with just a few clicks, you can create team draws that take into account the skill and experience of each player, thus eliminating disparities and "cliques." Being as comprehensive as possible, you can choose the number of teams, how many players in each team, and the sport played

## Problem Resolution
1. Creation of the "Pelada"
Start by defining your "Pelada" - the day of the week, time, and the sport played. Give your "Pelada" a name to make it unique and easy to identify.

2. Player Management
Add players who regularly attend your "Pelada." Enter their names and assign ratings from 1 to 5 stars to reflect their skills and experience.

3. Special Positions
Initially, MManager will work only with soccer or volleyball, where there are two key positions that must be considered when drawing. For example, in volleyball, the "Setter" is a crucial position, while in soccer, the "Goalkeeper" plays a fundamental role. Therefore, it is indispensable for each team to have its own.

4. Accurate Draws
When ready for the next game, indicate which players will be present and determine the number of teams and players per team. MManager does the rest.

5. Balanced Teams
The MManager algorithm will take care of creating balanced teams. Each team will have a special player (Setter or Goalkeeper) and an average of stars as close as possible, ensuring that each game is a fair competition.
